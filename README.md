👋 Hi, I’m Kate!

- 😄 Pronouns: any/all
- 👀 I’m interested in docs-like-code and software project management.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C/C++, Python, Git, Linux, Rest API, Postman, version control and CI/CD.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything requiring developer documentation or source/version control.
